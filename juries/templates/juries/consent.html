				<h2 class="headline">Informed Consent</h2>

				<h3 class="yellow">Purpose of Research</h3>

				<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment, "Digital Juries". Your contribution to our research helps us learn more how to better control content posted online in a way that keeps users safe while not preventing their freedom of expression.</p>


				<h3 class="yellow">What to Expect</h3>

				<p>This experiment will be in 3 parts. You will be shown 3 cases based on content that has been uploaded on social media and asked to decide what the toxicity level of the content is. You will also be asked what punishments should be taken against the original poster, if any. You may be asked to collaborate with other jury participants online to arrive at a single decision.</p>

				<p>This experiment is expected to take approximately 20-30 minutes.</p>

				<h3 class="yellow">Potential Risks</h3>

				<p>Content moderation has inherent risks. The cases in this study have been carefully curated by the researchers to assess potentially objectionable content in a more controlled setting than what content moderators may see on the job every day.</p>

				<p>You will be shown text and image-based content that may contain offensive language, hate speech, slurs, political dogwhistling (coded messages), and other forms of toxic speech.</p>

				<p>You will NOT be shown content containing nudity, pornography, or explicit graphic violence.</p>

				<p>You must be over the <strong>age of 18</strong> to participate.</p>


				<h3 class="yellow">What you should know about a research study:</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
					<li>Your participation is completely voluntary.</li>
					<li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
					<li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
					<li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
					<li>Your refusal to participate will not result in any consequences or any loss of benefits that you are otherwise entitled to receive.</li>
					<li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="yellow">Who to talk to:</h3>

				<p>If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, contact the <a href="mailto:jfan@mde.harvard.edu">research team</a>.</p>
